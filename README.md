# INTRO
This repo contains the projects done during the two-week bootcamp organised by **Lux Academy**.

## Week 1
The projects done included:
1. A python function to check whether a number is prime or not.
2. A python function that checks whether a number input by the user belongs to the FiBonacci sequence.

## Week 2
The project done was to build an Authentication System using a preferred Python framework. 
Django was chosen for this scenario.
